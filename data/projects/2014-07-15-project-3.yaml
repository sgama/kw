description: <div align="left"> <font size="4"> This project was developed in the new venture design program at UBC. I was part of a group of three engineering and two business students that developed 'Overboard' - a mountable device that warns small boats of incoming obstacles, specifically deadheads, using real time image analysis. <br> <br> Through extensive market research, we discovered that there was a market for this kind of product. Impact damage on small boats due to surface level obstacles was a primary concern amongst boat owners. In fact, some people we talked to were interested in becoming early adopters. Our work on this project led to our team becoming one of the finalists at the Pacific Venture Capital Conference (PVCC) and also winning the New Venture Design Award at UBC. <br> <br> The device uses infrared imagery for image processing and machine learning for obstacle detection. An infrared camera was necessary to capture useful images in murky waters and low visibility weather conditions. The machine learning model was developed using support vector machines (SVMs) for binary classification and location. SVMs were the chosen machine learning algorithm for this application due to its high prediction perfomance coupled with low processing power. <br> <br> A business model was also developed alongside a working product. We thoroughly analyzed the competitive landscape and our differentiating factor, built a go-to-market strategy, developed a revenue model and produced financial projections for the first three years. </font> </div>
