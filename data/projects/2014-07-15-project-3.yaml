description: <div align="left"> <font size="4"> This project was developed in the new venture design program at UBC. Three engineering and two business students developed 'Overboard' - a device that warns small boats of incoming obstacles, specifically deadheads, using real time image analysis. The device uses infrared imagery for image processing and machine learning for obstacle detection. The machine learning model was developed using support vector machines (SVMs) for binary classification and location. This project. Research was done on the competitive landscape and market. A business model was developed. Based on market research, there is a huge demand for a product like this. Impact damage on small boats due to surface level obstacles is a </font> </div>
